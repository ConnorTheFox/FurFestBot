# Midwest FurFest Countdown Bot
This is a bot that I made, it counts down the days until MFF in the form of a picture.

# Language
The bot was coded in Node.js

# Where to find my bot?
You can find my bot at

https://telegram.me/FurFestBot

# How to run?

If you want to run it for a different convention, or whatever else. Download the repository, and run
```
npm install
sudo apt install graphicsmagick
sudo apt install mongodb
```

You need two Telegram bot API keys, one for the main bot and another for the admin bot.

To upload photos use the upload.js script. The options for it are documented below. You will also need to use the DBNAME environment variable. And if needed the HOST and PORT variables.

Run your bot behind a https nginx reverse proxy with a path of /bot(token). If you don't know what this is [read this](https://www.nginx.com/resources/admin-guide/reverse-proxy/)

ex: /bot123abc58347589

Finally add cron.js to the crontab to send the daily picture.

If you want to run this bot on windows then you need to add graphicsmagick to your path and install mongodb.

### To setup the bot you need to edit 2 JS files and some environment variables.
