# Midwest FurFest Countdown Bot
This is a bot that I made, it counts down the days until MFF in the form of a picture.

# Language
The bot was coded in Node.js

# Where to find my bot?
You can find my bot at

https://telegram.me/FurFestBot

# How to run?

If you want to run it for a different convention, or whatever else. Download the repository, and run
```
npm install
sudo apt install graphicsmagick
sudo apt install mongodb
```

Run your bot behind a reverse proxy with a path of /bot(token). If you don't know what this is [read this](https://www.nginx.com/resources/admin-guide/reverse-proxy/)

ex: /bot123abc58347589

If you want to run this bot on windows then you need to add graphicsmagick to your path and install mongodb.
