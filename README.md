# How to run?

If you want to run it for a different convention, or whatever else. Download the repository, then run
```
npm install
```
Go into src/days.js and edit the date, then go into src/returns.js and edit the strings for returning the countdown picture. In main.js edit the string varibales for commands like /start.

Run main.js with enviroment variable TYPE, which is test or production. And TOKEN which is your telegram bot token.
